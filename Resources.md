## Git and Github

You will be using Github classroom, which requires a github.com account (not to be confused with Khoury College's Github Enterprise account). You will need to know how to use git to submit your assignments. Here are some resources to help you get started with git. For the most part, you are welcome (and encouraged) to use the built in IDE features for git, but it is good to know how to use the command line as well.
