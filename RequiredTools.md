to reach out and schedule time during office hours!

  - [Python](#python)
  - [GIT](#git)
  - [GitHub](#github)
  - [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code)



## Python
Even if you already have python on your system, you will need to make sure you have least version 3.10 installed. 

[Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, for Windows, you can installed Python through the
new windows store if you have Windows 11.  To test to make sure python is installed properly, open your
`Terminal` in windows type `python --version`, in macOS or linux, type `python3 --version`. Suggestion, make sure to restart your computer after installing before you check.

>  [!CAUTION]
>  By default, MacOS has python2.7 installed, and if you type python without the 3, it will
>  report that version. Make sure you have version 3 installed, as there is a very big
>  difference in syntax. 


## GIT

GIT is a version control system that we will use on our homeworks. We don't expect you to be experts in git (or github), but using the basic commands in this course will help prepare you for future courses (and careers) that expect git. 

For MacOS and linux clients, git is (usually) already installed. You are good to go. For windows, you will need to [download git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). 


You can check to make sure git is installed properly by typing in your terminal `git --version`

## GitHub


## Visual Studio Code

We will be using [Visual Studio Code]
